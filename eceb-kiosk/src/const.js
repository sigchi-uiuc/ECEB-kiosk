      "The ECE Building acheived LEED platinum certification in November 2019, and it is striving for a net-zero energy certification. From a vast array of photovoltaic cells, to a chilled beam system to cool and heat the classroom tower, ECE wil accomplish a major campus addition with maximum space and minimal carbon footprint.",
      "“Our building is the first large zero-net-energy facility in Illinois,” explains ECE Professor Phil Krein. “This really is a remarkable achievement for a large building with extensive laboratory activities in a highly variable climate. The design efforts, technology developments, renewable energy advances, and control practices that lead to this achievement have been years in the making. As you walk around the building, look for LED lighting, solar shading devices, an unusual water-cooled air conditioning system, and other features that help us reduce energy consumption in a uniquely collaborative space.”",

      "In 2016, Illinois took on an even greater leadership role when Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson signed its sister pledge, the Second Nature Resilience Commitment, which charges campus to examine the vulnerabilities of its landscapes and infrastructure in the face of an already changed climate. Together, these two commitments form Second Nature’s comprehensive Climate Commitment. As a charter signatory of the Climate Commitment, Illinois continues its dedication to being on the forefront of sustainable future planning.",

The university is proactively shaping its energy enterprise through improved utility production, distribution, and monitoring methods and systems. Through dedicated energy conservation programs, such as Retrocommissioning, Energy Performance Contracting, campus-wide lighting retrofits, and building system upgrades, the campus has reduced energy consumption by 28% since 2008.",
      "Though usually in the prairie, wind turbines can also be installed on top of a roof of a building. These rooftop wind turbines constitute one percent of the renewable energy market, and have a huge potential in urban and suburban areas. There is not a large market for them yet, but the benefits of these wind systems can include independence from the grid, and payback periods as little as five years. They demonstrate that it is possible for an individual residence to acheive 20 percent wind power in less than a year.",

Completion of this project will then grant the University of Illinois with the title of being the third-largest user of renewable power generated on-site for all higher education facilities in the entire country.  Solar Farm 2.0 is expected to contribute to 4.67% of the university's energy usage.",
